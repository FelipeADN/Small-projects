This is an implementation of the 2048 mobile game, made in C programming for a course I took at PUCPR.

The main file 2048.c contains the game logic and interface.
record.txt contains the player's best score.

The game is played with the w, a, s, d keys, followed by Enter for each play.
The interface was made on the terminal, and contains a few colors to emulate the real games interface.
